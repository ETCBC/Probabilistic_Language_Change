## Description
The project addresses the longstanding problem of linguistic dating of the Psalms. We will investigate the novel idea of analyzing the text by elaborating on techniques and concepts from the analysis of social networks. Specifically, a probabilistic model (Markov chain) will be developed that captures the linguistic structure of the ‘textual network’.

# Data Generation and Analysis

Data is generated in Text-Fabric using the ETCBC's BHSA database (version c). The data generation is stored in `bhsa_export.ipynb`, as well as a detailed record of the process of data set creation. 

Old data is moved to `archive` and then stored under a `kind/date` rubric.

    "## Research Question \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we gather and analyze data on linguistic tendencies accross select books in the Hebrew Bible. Our primary research question is: \n",
    "> **Can we cluster books of the Hebrew Bible based solely on linguistic state changes at the phrase and word levels?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A linguistic state change is any shift from one kind of linguistic unit to another when reading a text sequentially. An example is a shift from a `subject` phrase to a `predicate` phrase function. Another example is a shift from a `noun` to a `verb`. Traditionally Hebrew linguists have analyzed tendencies amongst select states, especially `subject`, `verb`, `object` (\"SVO\" or \"VSO\") (CITATION). These analyses may focus mainly on certain clause types (CITATION). Our analysis looks at any two state changes across phrase and word types. Specifically, we look at transitions in word type via part of speech and phrase type via function and phrase type. The potential values for these sets of features can be seen in the ETCBC's [BHSA documentation](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/features/hebrew/c/0_home.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This research question is significant for three reasons. First, Hebraists often disagree about the scope of difference between linguistic usage between various Hebrew books (CITATION). By testing whether linguistic patterns like state changes yield detectable differences, we can determine how syntax varies and changes within the corpus. Second, Hebraists commonly rely on telling morphological or lexical tendencies to classify the language of Hebrew books. Yet, this approach only takes into account a limited aspect of language use and does not look at subtle syntactic differences. But identifying these differences and classifying books based on them, we can obtain more robust categories for the books of the Hebrew Bible. Third, since the current methods of classification often focus on a limited range of features, it is important to test whether a syntactic analysis confirms the groupings of the literature. Traditional scholarship divides books into two broad classes: Late Biblical Hebrew (LBH) or Standard Biblical Hebrew (SBH). Scholars still debate the classification of books such as Ruth or Jonah. For this study, we exclude books with questionable classification in order to test the validity of the traditional groups. If we cannot falsify the traditional classes, then our model can in the future serve as a baseline against which to measure debateable books. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we test the following books and their traditional classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Books                                                                                         |\n",
    "|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| SBH   | Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel |\n",
    "| LBH   | Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles               |\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform the data selection and analysis using Python. For all of our analysis we use the Hebrew syntactic data provided by the [Eep Talstra Centere for Bible and Computer](http://www.etcbc.nl) (ETCBC), a research group in the [Faculty of Religion and Theology](https://www.godgeleerdheid.vu.nl/en/research/institutes-and-centres/eep-talstra-centre-for-bible-and-computer/index.aspx) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This is provided through the [Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Amstelodamensis](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/) (BHSA), an export of the ETCBC database in a format which can be easily processed in Python. Specifically, the data format is [Text-Fabric](https://dans-labs.github.io/text-fabric/) ([Dirk Roorda](https://github.com/dirkroorda) at DANS Labs) which likewise has an accompanying Python package for selecting and processing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We divide every book into narrative and quotation clauses, using the ETCBC labelings. The classification of narrative versus quotation is called the `domain` in the database. Thus, for each book, we test two domains. Within each domain (narrative vs. quotation) we look at bigrams in word or phrase types. A bigram is a selection of two given units (word or phrase) within the clause. The diagram below illustrates [phrase function](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/features/hebrew/c/function.html) bigrams and how they're delineated in Genesis 1:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"images/phrase_bigram_fig.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, each outline represents a separate bigram which is counted in our dataset. For this example, then, there are three bigrams. The counts would be made in our dataset accordingly:\n",
    "\n",
    "|      bigram        |  count |\n",
    "|--------------|---|\n",
    "| Time -> Pred | 1 |\n",
    "| Pred -> Subj | 1 |\n",
    "| Subj -> Objc | 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this for every clause per domain (narrative and quotation) and count each bigram individually. That is the first step. But these counts alone cannot tell us much about language properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research question asks whether these bigrams can be modeled as properties of language. That is, can sequential progressions of linguistic labels at the clause level function as indicators of linguistic tendencies. And furthermore, can these tendencies be used to classify and cluster books in the Hebrew Bible? If so, what do the results suggest about traditional groupings?\n",
    "\n",
    "A language \"tendency\" can be modeled in terms of probability. That is, when language users employs different styles or dialects, the probability that a certain linguistic form is followed by another is different. These probabilities of sequence can be modeled using the statistical concept of a Markov chain. A Markov chain models the probability of particular changes in a situation based on a starting point. One can imagine the predictive text of a mobile phone, which suggests probable words based on what is being typed. Markov chains are frequently utilized in the financial world to predict changes in the market. The diagram below illustrates a hypothetical Markov chain for this application:\n",

   "source": [
    "In a Markov chain, situations are called \"states.\" A shift from one state to another is known as a state transition. The likelihood of a certain state transition is called the transition probability. The chart shows three possible market states: a 'bull market', a 'bear market', or a 'stagnant market'. Based on past data of changes in the market, the chart shows the likelihood of arriving at any of these three states from another state. Imagining that we are in a bull market, we see that there is a very high probability, 0.9 (or 90%) that we remain in a bull market. On the other hand, there is a much smaller chance, 0.075 (or 7.5%) that we enter a bear market. Since these probabilities are calculated on past data, they tell us something about the tendencies of this given market. One could imagine, however, that these numbers would vary depending on the specific market in question. For example, perhaps this chart models the New York Stock Exchange, but in the Euronext Stock Exchange (Amsterdam) the likelihood of going from a bull market to a bear market is lower, say at 0.05 (5%). This might have further implications for how one plans to invest their money, because the data says something about the market's behavior and discrete properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, we can model the tendencies of a language and its constituent parts through a Markov chain. This statistical method is already used widely in the Natural Language Processing world for machine generated translations, morphological parsing, and word-sense disambiguation (CITATION). At the same time, Hebraists have long guessed that sequentiality says something about language tendency. Studies of Classical Hebrew often examine the way in which subject, verb, and object phrases order themselves around each other. These analyses are further used as indicators of chronological change in Hebrew, with proposals that Hebrew gradually shifted from a verb-subject-object language (VSO) to a subject-verb-object (SVO) language. These manual approaches are inherently limited, though, in their ability to measure all phrase types. Indeed, subject, verb, and objects are key to a sentence's syntax. But the manual approach does not take into account the interaction of other elements such as adverbial or adjectival phrases. Furthermore, there is a basic assumption that indeed subject, verb, and object phrases present the strongest indicators of linguistic change. But perhaps other, more subtle, indicators might show key differences? Finally, there is an inherent limitation in terms of the number of potential transitions which can be considered by a focused, manual approach. By the ETCBC database's setup, there are [thirty different phrase function labels](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/features/hebrew/c/function). Thus, to consider all possible combinations of these labels, one would have to individully examine 900 different patterns, punching pattern searches into a software program and sorting through the significance of each one. The Markov chain method, however, enables all of these patterns to be considered simultaneously, so that the most relevant differences can be seen and analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding on the example of Genesis 1:1, we can illustrate a primitive markov model based on that verse alone, which contains only three transitions: `Time -> Pred`, `Pred -> Subj`, and `Subj -> Objc`. Assuming our model has only \"seen\" this sentence, our Markov diagram would look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"images/markov_gen1.png\" height=\"30%\" width=\"30%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The probabilities are all equal since the ratios are obtained by dividing the transition count by the total number of values (in this case, 1÷3). Obviously, there is limited value in such a small-scale model, which really only tells us the probabilities of state changes within this sentence. But with the addition of more sentences, the model encapsulates more of the language's tendencies. For instance, if we add the transitions of Genesis 1:2 (first sentence only), we see the `Pred -> Subj` observation of Genesis 1:1 moderated with the `Subj -> Pred` pattern of Genesis 1:2:\n",

Clauses are grouped together by their domain and book (see above). The code below iterates through each domain, book, and clause in the dataset. As the code moves into and out of each clause, it adds a `Clause_End` and `Clause_Begin` feature. Adding these features allows us to consider the probability of a clause ending or beginning at a given feature state within a given book. The final transition counts are stored in a transition matrix, mapped to to the `feature`, `domain`, and `book` of the counts using embedded dictionaries. The purpose and structure of a transition matrix is explained further below."

    "Comparing these values with those for Nehemiah, we see that the differences in size have been mitigated. Nehemiah's `subs -> conj` transition is at 0.11 (11%) while the `subs -> subs` stands at 0.17 (17%). While different as compared with Genesis's 0.07 and 0.20's respective values, these values bring the narrative tendencies of Nehemiah much closer to Genesis than the raw data shows. It is these transition probabilities, for the three features of phrase function, phrase type, and word part of speech, which we use to compare the books of the Hebrew Bible."

    "## Research Question \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we gather and analyze data on linguistic tendencies accross select books in the Hebrew Bible. Our primary research question is: \n",
    "> **Can we cluster books of the Hebrew Bible based solely on linguistic state changes at the phrase and word levels?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A linguistic state change is any shift from one kind of linguistic unit to another when reading a text sequentially. An example is a shift from a `subject` phrase to a `predicate` phrase function. Another example is a shift from a `noun` to a `verb`. Traditionally Hebrew linguists have analyzed tendencies amongst select states, especially `subject`, `verb`, `object` (\"SVO\" or \"VSO\") (CITATION). These analyses may focus mainly on certain clause types (CITATION). Our analysis looks at any two state changes across phrase and word types. Specifically, we look at transitions in word type via part of speech and phrase type via function and phrase type. The potential values for these sets of features can be seen in the ETCBC's [BHSA documentation](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/features/hebrew/c/0_home.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This research question is significant for three reasons. First, Hebraists often disagree about the scope of difference between linguistic usage between various Hebrew books (CITATION). By testing whether linguistic patterns like state changes yield detectable differences, we can determine how syntax varies and changes within the corpus. Second, Hebraists commonly rely on telling morphological or lexical tendencies to classify the language of Hebrew books. Yet, this approach only takes into account a limited aspect of language use and does not look at subtle syntactic differences. But identifying these differences and classifying books based on them, we can obtain more robust categories for the books of the Hebrew Bible. Third, since the current methods of classification often focus on a limited range of features, it is important to test whether a syntactic analysis confirms the groupings of the literature. Traditional scholarship divides books into two broad classes: Late Biblical Hebrew (LBH) or Standard Biblical Hebrew (SBH). Scholars still debate the classification of books such as Ruth or Jonah. For this study, we exclude books with questionable classification in order to test the validity of the traditional groups. If we cannot falsify the traditional classes, then our model can in the future serve as a baseline against which to measure debateable books. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we test the following books and their traditional classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Books                                                                                         |\n",
    "|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| SBH   | Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel |\n",
    "| LBH   | Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles               |\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform the data selection and analysis using Python. For all of our analysis we use the Hebrew syntactic data provided by the [Eep Talstra Centere for Bible and Computer](http://www.etcbc.nl) (ETCBC), a research group in the [Faculty of Religion and Theology](https://www.godgeleerdheid.vu.nl/en/research/institutes-and-centres/eep-talstra-centre-for-bible-and-computer/index.aspx) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This is provided through the [Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Amstelodamensis](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/) (BHSA), an export of the ETCBC database in a format which can be easily processed in Python. Specifically, the data format is [Text-Fabric](https://dans-labs.github.io/text-fabric/) ([Dirk Roorda](https://github.com/dirkroorda) at DANS Labs) which likewise has an accompanying Python package for selecting and processing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We divide every book into narrative and quotation clauses, using the ETCBC classifications. The classification of narrative versus quotation is called the `domain` in the database. Thus, for each book, we test two domains. Within each domain (narrative vs. quotation) we look at bigrams in word or phrase types. A bigram is a selection of two given units (word or phrase) within the clause. The diagram below illustrates bigrams and how they're delineated in Genesis 1:1.\n",
